# About Me

My name is Mark Delk, but I often go by the nickname Jethro.

I'm a programmer, a CS student, and a musician, among other things. I'm
based out of the Memphis, TN area.

I'm good with Unix, Ruby, Java, Python, and SQL, to name a few.
If you'd like to get in touch, of if your team needs help, feel free to contact me.
