I'm a programmer, a CS student, and a musician, among other things. I'm
based out of the Memphis, TN area.

If you'd like to get in touch, my email is at the bottom of the page. I'm
currently looking for a job in the software or web development industries; if
your team needs help, feel free to contact me with an offer.
