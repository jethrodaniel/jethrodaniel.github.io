# About Me

My name is Mark Delk, but I often go by the nickname Jethro.

I'm a programmer, a CS student, and a musician, among other things. I'm
based out of the Memphis, TN area.

I'm right at home working with Java, Linux administration (Debian, mostly),
Ruby (and Rails), Git, Python, general web-design (HTML5/CSS3), and SQL. I'm also
interested in C# and C++.

If you'd like to get in touch, of if your team needs help, feel free to contact
me.
