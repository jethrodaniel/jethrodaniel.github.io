# About Me

My name is Mark Delk, but I often go by the nickname Jethro.

I'm a programmer, a CS student, and a musician, among other things. I'm
based out of the Memphis, TN area.

Some things I like:
  - Ruby (and Rails)
  - Git
  - Linux administration
  - Java, Python, C#, C/C++

Some things I don't like:
  - Unnecessary GUIs
  - Inconsistent indentation
